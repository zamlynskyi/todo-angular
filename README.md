# ToDo Angular App

This project was generated using **Angular CLI version 20.0.0**.

## 🛠 Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

---

## 🧱 Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

---

## 📦 Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.  
By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## 🧪 Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the **Karma** test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

---

## 🚀 Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.  
You can choose one that suits your project (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Protractor).
